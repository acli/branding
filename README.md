## Logo cropped

The cropped logo should be used
only when an appropriate amount of white space
has already been designed into an existing layout.
This applies when you use the logo
as a profile picture to identify the CFF project,
for example on GitHub or on social media.

## Logo uncropped

In all other cases, the uncropped logo should be used.
