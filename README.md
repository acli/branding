This repository holds anything to do with the visual identity of the Citation File Format.

# Guidelines

## Logo

Please use the logo only to identify the CFF project.

If you use the logo on a website or any digital media that supports alternate text,
the correct alt text is usually “CFF”,
“Citation File Format”
or an appropriate translation.
(“Logo”, “CFF logo” or similar are usually incorrect.)

### Cropped logo

The cropped logo should be used
only when an appropriate amount of white space
has been designed into an existing layout,
for example when you use the logo
as a profile picture on GitHub
to identify the CFF project
(or on social media where the profile picture will not be cropped to fit a circle).

### Uncropped logo

In all other cases, the uncropped logo should be used.

If it is more convenient to use the cropped logo,
the cropped logo should be surrounded by whitespace
that mimics the whitespace that has been built into the uncropped logo
(15% margin on all four sides).
