Anything to do with the visual identity of the Citation File Format


## Logo cropped

The cropped logo should be used
only when an appropriate amount of white space
has already been designed into the layout.
This applies when you use the logo
to identify the CFF project on GitHub or on social media.

## Logo uncropped

In all other cases, the uncropped logo should be used.
