Problem statement
=================
The original logo was set in Roboto Condensed Regular, with #2a7fff chosen as background colour.
This original version can be found at commit f44a5be6ebb483453f70f158c0571e451b8d7d49

The original composition seems to suffer from a couple of potential problems:
- According to Illustrator, #2a7fff is equivalent to 75C 51M, but
  according to [1, p. 12], 75C 50M in print looks very different.
  The chosen colour is probably out of gamut for print.
- According to [2], the logo was originally designed for GitHub, but potential uses would
  include websites and slides. Legibility for slides might or might not have ben tested.
- The uncropped logo is currently used for GitHub, where the cropped version is more
  appropriate. This suggests branding guidelines [2] are indeed necessary.
- The composition looks fine at default size, but on the README page,
  where one image pixel is displayed as 1 device pixel ,
  it is visually off centre.
