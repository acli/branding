The original logo was set in Roboto Condensed, with #2a7fff chosen as background colour.
This original version can be found at commit f44a5be6ebb483453f70f158c0571e451b8d7d49

Problems with the original composition:
- According to Illustrator, #2a7fff is equivalent to 75C 51M, but
  according to [1, p. 12], 75C 50M in print looks very different.
  The chosen colour is probably out of gamut for print.
