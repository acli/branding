Tweaks to logo
==============

Some *very* minor tweaks have been made to the logo
to demonstrate what we might want to be mindful of when we do the new logo.

Note that these are *very* minor adjustments.
They are only visible when the logo is used at a large size
(e.g., on README.md or, potentially, on a conference banner).

Goals
-----

Such tweaks are necessary because visual centre is often different from mechanical or mathematical centre.
The two tweaks attempt to improve visual balance between letters (kerning)
and visual alignment of the word *CFF* inside the rounded square (what Adobe calls optical margins).

Method
------

The SVG is loaded into Adobe Illustrator CS6 and minor tweaks were made,
first by arrow keys (1-point adjustments),
then by menu commands (0.5-point adjustments at first, then 0.1-point, then 0.05-point adjustments).
After tweaking by trial and error,
the file was exported to PNG at 225 dpi
so that the final PNG was 400px × 400px.

Results
-------

The final adjustments made were the following:

- The spacing between *C* and *FF* is reduced by 0.7 points.
- After the above adjustment, *CFF* is shifted right by 0.05 points.
