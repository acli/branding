Tweaks to logo
==============

Some *very* minor tweaks have been made to the logo
to demonstrate what we should be mindful of when we do the new logo.

Note that these are *very* minor adjustments.
They are only visible when the logo is used at a large size.

- The spacing between *C* and *FF* is reduced by 0.7 points.
- After the above adjustment, *CFF* is shifted right by 0.05 points.
